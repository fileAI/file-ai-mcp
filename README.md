# üìò fileAI MCP Server Overview

The fileAI MCP Server offers a robust set of tools to work with the fileAI file processing pipeline. It allows for uploading files, performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR), classifying documents, and extracting structured data.
The server leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide seamless integration with AI models, enabling them to work with your documents programmatically.

## ‚ú® Features
* End-to-end File Processing: From file upload to structured data extraction ‚Äî manage the entire lifecycle of your files
* AI-Powered: Leverage powerful AI models for OCR, file classification, and structured data extraction.
* Schema Management: Define, update, and manage schemas to control how data is extracted for your specific needs
* Asynchronous Processing: Upload files and track processing status asynchronously
